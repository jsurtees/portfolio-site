  <h2 class="text-header pad-t">Research</h2>
  <p class="text-body push-2">Some important uncoverd information: The main target audience is students - people who drink and throw parties often. Also people with disabilities or who lack transportation. The demographic is generally mid-low income, largest market for alcohol is in white males 19-45, often college and university students. The psychographics - generally normal people, though there are some who have formed bad habits and use this service to help in continuing these habits. The tone has to be young and fresh, simple but creative and portray a key message. The previous logo is a scene at night so the redesign will focus more towards bright and easy. The key message is simple, fast, effective. A big creative consideration is that there is an obvious problem of creating something that looks like it represents mixing alcohol and driving.</p>
